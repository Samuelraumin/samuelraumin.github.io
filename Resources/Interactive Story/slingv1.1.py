"Listen kid, that fool Cain McDonald has been tormenting Copper Falls for years and it doesn't seem to be stopping. It's risky right now, but we can get the right equipment and weapons, find another person to help, and have a plan, I believe we can do it." 
"Why are you asking me", you asked concerned. 
"You seem like a tough guy and I need as much help as I can get, again I know it's risky but if it's done, a whole lotta help will come the the town and you can get a good amount of pay on his head. So what says you, you willing to join me?" (yes or no)

"Why would I help you. You are a drunk maniac!"
"Because you will be bring a lot of good to Copper Falls. Face it, that gang is not going to leave. Someone needs to take this issue into there own hands.  We need to stop them."

He continues that their is a rooftop that is the prefect place to get the shot. He warns that there are always two men on both side of the leader, and that we need to shoot them as well.
You get to the rooftop and set down the blanket full of equipment. You open the cover of the blanket and are confronted with the rifle you will be using. You set up and you are ready to go.

Days later the county police came over to give you two a handsome reward, Congaher declined the bounty and let you keep it all. A couple of months in McDonald's sentence, he somehow broke out and ran off somewhere. Unfortunately, your dream to McDonald to change his lfe is broken, Congaher utilized this opportunity to hunt him down. You never saw Bill Conagher ever again, you simply continued with your life with a lotta money.

Thinking hard, you realize what Conagher said before, that killing McDonald will make to town a better place, a safer place. "Yeah, finish him off Conagher. I wnat this town safer.""Thanks Carson, it's a real pleasure." snickered Conagher. then a loud bang came. Days after this fight, people started to flow into the town more often, the town also began to have more shops popping up. After the shoot-out, you and Conagher got quiet a handsome reward from the local county police for what you two did, but Conagher let you have all of the money. Apparently after killing McDonald, Conagher was satified with life after gaining redemption.
