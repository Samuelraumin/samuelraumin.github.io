  <p>One difficulty my partner and I had was an issue pertaining to the possibility of the system crashing while trying to find the private key numbers with our program. We decided to rely on the usage of a loading function that tells the user with information loading (telling the user at what point the program is working). Another difficulty we ran into was the issue of flipped variables in the encrypt/decrypt function. The solution was to simply flip the function variables that were being called. An opportunity that I had during this project was working with my partner Dane, who was able to give me some huge tips on programming this project. The part I worked on independently was reworking the encryption/decryption function with the desired generated outputs.
  </p>
  <p> At the beginning of the video, the user has a couple different options: they can run the while loop function mainmenu() to run the main system of the code, or they can optional run encrypt(e, n) or decrypt (d, n) as separate functions. In the demonstration, by using the main menu() function, the user is provided with a series of numbers to access different commands. The user can optional generate RSA encryption keys that will be stored in the recommended variables, making the process much easier.
