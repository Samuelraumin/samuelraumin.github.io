  <p>One difficulty my partner and I had was an issue pertaining to our experience in Java programming relating to the different kinds of program calls that were necessary to achieve our goals when building the clock. The solution to this issue was to study the java documentation, more specifically the Java Swing Library documentation. Another difficulty we ran into was related to switch function. The solution was in order to achieve the programs constant checking for change from the Simple Date Format variable labeled SDF, the switch function would need to be used, constantly assigning new information in a linear pattern, starting from time, to date, today. An opportunity that I had during this project was to work with the Java programming language, as I had little experience beforehand. The part I worked on independently was reworking the clock switch function to make it display what we wanted to make the clock useful.
  </p>
  <p> When you first start up the program, you will be greeted with the main clock GUI window. The Information is listed in order from top to bottom: time (hours, minutes, seconds), date (Month, day, year) and the day of the week. At the top left, a menu is provided with the options to set an alarm and an exit. When the clock reaches the desired time, a new dialog box will be created to alert the user of the event. When the user selects the exit option, the program quits and exits.
