  <p>My partner in making of this project is Cody Schieferstine. For the most part, Cody was the creator of the story and the elements of the game, while a few ideas did come from me. Most of the more advance coding such as the typing animation and the global variables was created and organized by me, but Cody did give idea and solution to the loopback functions. We did run into a couple bugs and errors with the program. One main problem we had was organizing all the text. The solution that we came up with was the use of global variables to make the sections more clear. Another problem we ran into was the use of multiple variable raw inputs and their determined output. The solution we came up with is to create a better systems of naming variables to contain the input by creating seperate names for each kind of input. 
  </p>
  <p>When you start the program, there will be a transition that will present the title "SLING: A Western Story". Under the title, there is text that prompts the user to either type "Start" or "Info". Typing "Start" will begin the story, while typing "Info" will guide the user to the info page, with a large title "INFO", presenting the information. On the very bottom of the page will show the creators, a link to the project's github repository, and a prompt to type "Back" to go back to the title screen. When going through the story, prompts to type a certain command will be presented to the user, such as more specific commands such as “walk” or “ignore, to more simplistic answer such as “yes” or “no”. A series of choices have to made by the player to advance in the story. When your character dies, the player will be presented with an ASCII text the title "YOU DIED" will show up and the user will have to restart the game.</p>
